# CourseProject
This is my Course Project that I have worked on throughout my time in MSSA (Microsoft Software and Systems Academy). The app is called Zenish, and is a simple web-based application for somebody who may be curious about Zen Buddhism.

There are three core functions of the page.
1. "learn" - A compilation of eight simple basic lessons that I have created myself to explain the basics of Zen.
2. "koan" - Collection of paradoxes that are traditional practice in Zen, which are pondered upon and break up the common perspective of a situation.
3. "wisdom" - Quotes that I have hand-selected from famous Zen/Buddhist Masters throughout time that have profound wisdom and understanding.

The goal of this project is that someobody could log on to the page, and within a fair amount of time be able have a simple grasp of Zen. From this, I hope that it will bring some clarity and peace for the viewer.
